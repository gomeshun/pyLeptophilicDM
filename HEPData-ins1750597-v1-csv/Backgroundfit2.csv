#: name: Background fit 2
#: description: Observed events and predicted post-fit background yields in the VRs. For backgrounds whose normalisation is extracted from the fit in the CRs, the yield expected from the simulation before the fit is also reported. The background denoted as "Other" includes the non-dominant background sources for this analysis, i.e. Z+jets, $t\bar t$ +V, Higgs and Drell-Yan events. A "â€“" symbol indicates that the background contribution is negligible.
