#: name: Background fit 4
#: description: Observed events and predicted post-fit background yields for the SF inclusive SRs. The model independent upper limits at 95% confidence level (CL) on the observed and expected number of beyond the SM events $S^{0.95}_{obs/exp}$ and the effective beyond the SM cross-section $\sigma^{0.95}_{obs}$ are also reported. The last row reports the $p_0$-value of the SM-only hypothesis. For SRs where the data yield is smaller than expected, the $p$-value is truncated at 0.50. The background denoted as "Other" in the Table includes the non-dominant background sources for this analysis, i.e. Z+jets, $t\bar t$+V, Higgs and Drell-Yan events. A "â€“" symbol indicates that the background contribution is negligible.
