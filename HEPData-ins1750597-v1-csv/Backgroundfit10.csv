#: name: Background fit 10
#: description: Observed events and predicted background yields from the fit in the binned SF SRs with $n_{non-b-tagged jets}=1$. For backgrounds whose normalisation is extracted from the fit in the CRs, the yield expected from the simulation before the fit is also reported. The background denoted as "Other" in the Table includes the non-dominant background sources for this analysis, i.e. Z+jets, $t\bar t$ +V, Higgs and Drell-Yan events. A "â€“" symbol indicates that the background contribution is negligible.
