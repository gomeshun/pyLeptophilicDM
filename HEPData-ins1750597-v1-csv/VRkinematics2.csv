#: name: VR kinematics 2
#: description: Distributions of $m_{T2}$ in VR-top-high for data and the estimated SM backgrounds. The normalisation factors extracted from the corresponding CRs are used to rescale the $t\bar t$, single top, WW, WZ and ZZ backgrounds. The fake and non-prompt leptons background (FNP) is calculated using the data-driven matrix method. The uncertainty band includes all sources of systematic and statistical errors and the last bin includes the overflow.
